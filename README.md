# HR-Clustering

Data Exploration

Before the implementation of the clustering method, the data was cleaned and converted into a usable format. Such as removing missing values, 
checking for distinct values as well as non-relevant features to avoid biases from the model and provide better results 

Data was located using open-source platforms, to solve the business problem of health issues during migration to Australia. Climate data gathered with 
a focus on factors related to temperature, humidity, rainfall, altitude, UV, etc. with the aim being to use that data in determining which countries/geographic areas are most similar in terms of climate to
postcodes of Australia.
A high level of research and literature review was also completed by all team members, to build an understanding of the needs and possible solutions. After reviewing the available
data, the decision was made to limit focus to temperature data. This provides only a partial view of climate but would be appropriate to provide informative insights via the MVP with
the hope that it could be expanded to include other climate factors in future phases.
